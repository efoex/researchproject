    <h1>This study would build on existing literature by offering a closer look into the incremental effects of ACEs as detrimental to development and future achievements. This information could help to inform policies in local schools, correctional and rehabilitation facilities, and communities. Knowing the link between poor academic achievements and crime, this data could help to inform smart community policies to emphasize child development and opportunity while educating families on best practices. The data from this study would be especially important to the juvenile justice and child welfare departments as it could serve to deter future engagements with those systems.</h1>
