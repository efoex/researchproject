    <h1>As someone with a host of ACEs in my formative years that had deleterious effects on my educational bearing, I want to understand more about the relationship between these early traumatic experiences and later academic success. Do adverse or traumatic experiences in childhood negatively impact academic prosperity?

Are relational findings between ACEs and academic progress universal, strongly implied, or highly variable by individual personality traits? Is this something worth additional time and resources, or is it a negligible occurrence?

Is there a certain point where the number of ACEs begins to impact academic ability negatively, or does the implication apply to any level of exposure?

I believe the relationship does exist and that there is a certain point where the number of ACEs begins to impact chances for academic success more significantly.

If true, this would give great starting points to create policies that address known adversities. We could look more extensively into targeted efforts to reduce the occurrence of these traumatic experiences to provide youths every opportunity to excel in school.
If untrue, it would suggest additional research is necessary to determine other potential implications of ACEs and other shared factors that might detract from academic success.
