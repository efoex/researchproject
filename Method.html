    <h1>	Method & Design</h1><BR><br><center><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/jedjL3yxUCA9zOj6YyOAdDDg3dc=/800x450/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NGNKVGWTRRCZBIVE62UWRI4GYI.jpg"></center>
	  <div><p>Research participants willl come from local area high school senior classes, colleges, and universities. The initial plan is to utilize high school guidance counselors, home-room instructors, and administrative officials to obtain necessary IRB clearance for the underage participants according to protocol. Following IRB protocol, after obtaining parental consent documentation it is critical to then also obtain the agreement of the children to participate in the study, or the child assent. Because understanding varies wildly during childhood years it is pertinent to utilize age-appropriate and approved methods of ensuring children are properly informed of the scope and nature of their participation.<br><br>
The research study will utilize a combination of participant survey and interview alongside textual analysis. The study will gather participant-generated data via survey and interview as these are best methods when considering personal experiences that helped to shape participants and their academic propensity. Participants will undergo a standard ACE test before sitting down for an interview with preselected questions. After the standardized questioning is complete, testers will issue open-ended questions to gather more information not specifically requested in previous questions. Similarly, other confirming information relating to academic success will be garnered via textual analysis with documents from high school diplomas and current college enrollment and transcript data. <br><br>
All colleges, universities, and high schools in the Portland-Vancouver area will receive copies of the ACE surveys intended for the study (included below).<br><br>
Diverging from previous research ventures (that typically looked for ACE scores of 4 or above to include in studies), all participants who indicate at least 1 ACE will move forward into the interview stage and the test group. Participants at the high-school senior level (17-18 years) who indicate at least 1 ACE and any who implies they do not intend to pursue further education will enter the interview stage and test group. The study will exclude any participants who indicate they have experienced 0 ACEs as determined by the questionnaire, unless they fall into the high school senior participant group. <br>
<br>It is the belief that this test group is most suitable for the study as it will look at both students who might currently struggle with furthered education while including others who choose not to continue schooling after high school, thus typically not comprising representation in contemporary studies.
