    <p>According to Hinojosa, Nguyen, Sellers, and Elassar, “Adults that have been exposed to ACE report lower years of educational attainment have a lower odds of completing a college degree, and generally have poorer employment outcomes.”<BR><BR><BR>

<i>Hinojosa, R., Nguyen, J., Sellers, K., & Elassar, H. (2019). Barriers to college success among students that experienced adverse childhood events. Journal of American College Health, 67(6), 531–540. https://doi-org.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/10.1080/07448481.2018.1498851</i><br><BR><BR>

While these findings suggest a connection between exposure to ACEs and barriers to academic success on one college campus, the obstacles were not explicitly related to the ACEs but linked to current family hardships impacting intellectual engagement and subsequent success.

Moreover, Larson, Chapman, Spetz, and Brindis posit their research “…shows that children and adolescents exposed to chronic childhood trauma are at increased risk for developing mental health disorders. Mental health disorders have been linked to a greater risk for poor academic achievement.”<br><br><br>

<i>Larson, Chapman, S., Spetz, J., & Brindis, C. D. (2017). Chronic Childhood Trauma, Mental Health, Academic Achievement, and School‐Based Health Center Mental Health Services. The Journal of School Health, 87(9), 675–686. https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.12541</i><BR><BR><BR>

Though this study suggests a strong correlation between ACEs and barriers to academic success, the researchers looked more closely at chronic childhood trauma rather than a spectrum of exposure to ACEs. Findings more specifically suggest chronic exposure to ACEs increases the risk of developing mental health conditions that subsequently impact academic achievement abilities rather than making a direct link from the ACEs to academic achievement.

I hope to add to this conversation by looking more closely into the questions posed by Larson, Chapman, Spetz, and Brindis about the impacts of childhood trauma on future academic success. However, I would like to widen the scope to include participants not necessarily exposed to chronic trauma to determine if there is a certain point where traumatic experiences begin to impact academic success negatively.
