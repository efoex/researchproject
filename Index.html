     <p> The CDC-Kaiser Permanente ACE Study found that 64% of American adults have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience. While this hardly comes as a surprise, the real shock is in the immediate and long-lasting impact of these experiences on developing minds and immune systems. Findings suggest that while ACEs contribute to most mental illnesses and a host of other diseases later in life, it is possible to build back some of what is lost to childhood interactions with toxic stress. 
<br><br>
While CDC-Kaiser Permanente efforts surrounding ACEs highlight the importance of appropriate intervention to teach healthy responses and repair the damage of toxic stress, we know less about the relationship between ACEs and their impact on academic achievement. This topic is essential because it deals with future generationsâ€™ propensity for educational success and our societal future. Understanding more about potential links between ACEs and academic success could help us create policies to address recognized contributors and foster healthier communities.
